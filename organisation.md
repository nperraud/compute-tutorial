            - requirements.txt
            - Docker
            - Other (text)
        * What compute cases do you need to be supported (for heavy compute, i.e when a GPU or large amount of CPU, RAM is needed)?
            - Python virtual environment (conda, poetry, ...) CLI
            - Python Notebooks
            - VSCode/PyCharm remote connections
            - R code
            - Other (text)
        * What are the main Python library you use:
            - Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn

            - Tensorflow
            - Jax
            - WandB
            - Other(text)
        * Beside getting one strong node with a big GPU (with up to 80GB of RAM), what other needs would you like to be supported? (Be realistic)
            - Text
        * Would you use a jupyterlab service at CSCS? Or would you allways prefer to use a remote kernel using VSCode or PyCharm?
            - I always prefer VSCode or PyCharm
            - I would use jupyterlab
            - I have no clue what your are talking about

        * Any remarks?

Check with An:
* Powercords

* Check with Tasko
* Ensure that the CSCS program is being done
